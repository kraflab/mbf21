# Modder's Best Friend aka MBF21 v1.2
MBF21 is the next step in the classical / conservative feature progression from doom to boom to mbf. The project has these goals:

- Fix bugs and miscellaneous issues in mbf.
- Maintain backwards compatibility with the features of mbf.
- Make it easy to modify previously hard-coded elements of the engine.
- Add "low hanging fruit" features for maps and dehacked that are in demand.
- Make changes that are easy to adapt into existing source ports and tools.
- Maintain the classical / conservative flavour of boom / mbf.

##### About the Project
The formal effort officially began in [March 2021](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/120616-lets-talk-about-mbf-a-new-complevel/). Following extensive discussions and investigations, kraflab and Xaser delivered the first implementation of the specification in [dsda-doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom) two months later.
